# golden-demo
Hey I'm not sure what happened to my Unity files? When I build and ran, Unity crashed and my save is completely gone? Like I have the demo, but all the code and scenes with Fungus is completely gone? I'm an individual so this was my first crash incident with Unity and I'm not sure how to fix it?
